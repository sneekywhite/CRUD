## Introduction

This FastAPI project provides a basic CRUD API that interacts with a postgres database. It allows you to create, read, update, and delete items. The API uses a simple database schema with two columns: `name` and `user id`.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 
- Python packages: `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `psycopg2`,`sqlalchemy`,`psycopg2-binary`

You can install the required Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.


## Prerequisites

1. git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo

2. install postgresql and pgAdmin4 on your machine
3. Configure your postgres database connection by modifying the connection string in the database.py file with your database credentials:
4. Run the FastAPI app using uvicorn:
    uvicorn main:app --reload
5. Your API should now be running locally. Access it at http://localhost:8000/docs to interact with the API using Swagger documentation.


## API Endpoints
